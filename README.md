# simple-frontend-project

### Sometimes you want to create a simple front-end web project, without using a framework, but you still want to take advantage of a Web server with hot reload, and use languages like Sass for stylesheets and TypeScript instead of JavaScript only.

### âš¡ This starter uses the awesome [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) to handle all of that, just install it, start the server and go!

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run dev

# build
$ npm run build

# preview
$ npm run preview
```
